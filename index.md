# Future Attorney. Former Economic Consultant.

I'm Sanjana Kaicker, an incoming 1L at Boston University School of Law with a deep interest in international economic law, particularly trade policy, treaty formation, and the legal mechanics behind economic sanctions and tariffs.

Before law school, I worked as a Senior Associate at Ankura Consulting Group, where I conducted data-driven analysis in high-stakes healthcare disputes, collaborating with top law firms and leading experts on payor–provider litigation and pharmacy pricing investigations.

I'm passionate about bridging law, policy, and data—a thread that's run through my experiences in consulting, economics research, product management, and international affairs.
