# About Me

Hello! I'm Sanjana Kaicker, and I'm currently a litigation consultant based in Washington, DC. I specialize in providing support for commercial healthcare disputes. I'm an avid reader, and I love exploring new ideas and interests.

I'm an incoming Juris Doctor student with a planned focus in international trade law, and I hope to understand and analyze the regulatory impacts of economic sanctions and investment treaties.
