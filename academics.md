# Academic Interests

At Cornell, I was the only student to complete a thesis written fully in French, called *La beauté est dans la rue: Une généalogie transnationale des pratiques contestataires françaises.*

This undergraduate thesis, written through the Department of Romance Studies (French) at Cornell University, examines protest practices since May 68 through a political sociology lens. Tracing the roots of proletariat power through youth and multinational activism, *La beauté est dans la rue* aims to understand the ways in which collective action is supported and reformed by entities in order to create a framework of intersectional solidarity. This work features ethnographical analysis, visual case studies, and media/discourse analysis.

You can view the self-published version on Amazon [here] (https://www.amazon.com/beaut%C3%A9-est-dans-transnationale-contestataires-ebook/dp/B0C888PLG5).
