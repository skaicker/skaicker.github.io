### Academic Interests

At Cornell, I was the only student to complete a thesis written fully in French, called *La beauté est dans la rue: Une généalogie transnationale des pratiques contestataires françaises.*
This thesis uses and analyzes photographs from the 2022 May Day protests in Paris.

Photos and more of an explanation to come soon!
