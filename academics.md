# Academic Interests

At Cornell, I was the only student to complete a thesis written fully in French, called *La beauté est dans la rue: Une généalogie transnationale des pratiques contestataires françaises.*

This undergraduate thesis, written through the Department of Romance Studies (French) at Cornell University, examines protest practices since May 68 through a political sociology lens. Tracing the roots of proletariat power through youth and multinational activism, La beauté est dans la rue aims to understand the ways in which collective action is supported and reformed by entities in order to create a framework of intersectional solidarity. This work features ethnographical analysis, visual case studies, and media/discourse analysis.

Photos and more of an explanation to come soon!
